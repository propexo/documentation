## Appointment Scheduling

When scheduling appointments with a Property Management System, there are some important considerations to keep in mind. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up appointments, and how each PM system differs in its approach to scheduling. The primary point of consideration is around the lack of time zone/daylight savings time support in most PM systems, which can lead to confusion and scheduling errors.  Because so many systems do not store any time zone configuration for a given property, we recommend that you add configuration to your database to store each property's timezone information.  

While it may be possible to automatically calculate the appropriate timezone for each property based upon the property's address information, the quality and completeness of property address information may not always be adequate to accurately calculate the appropriate timezone for a property.  Regardless of how you choose to configure the timezone settings in your system, we strongly recommend that you perform live testing with each property before going live.  This will ensure that any appointments created or modified via AccessAPI will be scheduled at the expected time for end users.
