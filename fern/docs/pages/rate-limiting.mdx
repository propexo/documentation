# Understanding Propexo's Rate Limits

To get the most out of the Propexo API, it’s important to understand how rate limits work and how to stay within them. This guide breaks it all down in simple terms and offers tips to help you manage your API usage efficiently.

## What Are Propexo’s Rate Limits?

By default, Propexo allows up to **150 requests per minute**. Depending on your contract, this number might be higher or lower. These limits help keep the system stable and ensure fair access for everyone.

If you're making frequent requests just to check for updates (known as **polling**), we strongly recommend utilizing our **webhooks** instead. Webhooks allow you to receive notifications when certain operations are complete, removing the need to poll the API repeatedly.

> **Note:** In addition to Propexo's rate limits, individual PMS platforms also enforce their own rate limits. These limits can impact how frequently Propexo is able to sync with your PMS, which may cause confusion if you're expecting real-time data updates. Always consider **both sets of rate limits** when troubleshooting data delays.

## When Is API Data Updated?

The data returned by the API is refreshed in two situations:

1. **When a sync request runs with your property management system (PMS).**
2. **After a successful write operation** (like updating or creating data).

These syncs usually happen **every 12 hours**, but your schedule might differ depending on your integration. If you poll the API more frequently than the sync schedule, you won’t see any new data—but the requests will still count towards your limit.

## How Can I Monitor My Usage, and How Are Limits Applied?

Each API response includes helpful headers that show your current usage:

- `x-ratelimit-limit`: The total number of requests allowed per minute.
- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests you have left in the current minute.

If you use **80%** of your allowed requests, the API will slow things down slightly by adding a **2-second delay** between requests.  
If you hit **100%**, the API will return a **429 error** and block new requests until the minute resets. After that, you’re good to go again.

## Tips for Staying Within the Limit

- Use **webhooks** instead of polling whenever possible.
- Avoid making redundant requests if your data hasn't changed.
- Monitor the **rate limit headers** in responses to track your usage.
- Keep in mind the rate limits of your PMS as well as Propexo’s.

By following these simple practices, you’ll keep your API usage efficient, avoid rate limit errors, and ensure reliable performance for your applications. If you ever need a custom rate limit based on your use case, feel free to reach out to us.
