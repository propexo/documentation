          description: A list of the specific models to sync. This will only ingest the
            models specified during the sync and any relational models. For
            example, requesting "residents" and "leases" will also query their
            relational data. This can be used for times when only a limited
            amount of data would like to be synced. If you'd like this as part
            of your scheduled syncs, please contact Propexo support.
